# Data Types

# Strings

# Example of subscripting
# The [number] value tells Python what letter "index" we would like to print
# Python indexing starts at "0", which represents the first letter

print("Hello"[0]) # H
print("Hello"[1]) # e
print("Hello"[2]) # l
print("Hello"[3]) # l
print("Hello"[4]) # o

print("123") # Though this is a number, it is treated as a string due to the quotes
print(type("123")) # returns as type 'str'

# Integers
# Whole numbers, no decimal places
print(123 + 345)

# Large Integers
# We would normally use commas to split large integers
# In Python, we replace the commas with underscores
print(123_456_789)


# Floats
# Integers with Decimal places
print(3.14159)


# Booleans

print(True)
